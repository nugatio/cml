	abstract = {We revisit the classic semi‐parametric problem of inference on a low‐dimensional parameter θ0 in the presence of high‐dimensional nuisance parameters η0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high‐dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high‐dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N−1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman‐orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0; (2) making use of cross‐fitting, which provides an efficient form of data‐splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N−1/2‐neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.},

However, existing statistical models neither analyse nor capture the diffusion of armed conflict, and hence do not adequately account for its dependence across both time and space. To address this, we introduce a regression approach that simultaneously captures both spatial and temporal dimension of the diffusion of armed conflict through nonparametric smoothing, while all its effects and parameters remain fully interpretable. Using fine-grained conflict data on Africa, we observe that diffusion exhibits long-lasting and far-reaching dependencies that decay exponentially in both space and time, thus highlighting the importance of controlling for these effects. We illustrate the flexibility of our method for studying conflict diffusion by investigating the role of population in the transmission of conflict. We find that conflict typically breaks out in densely populated areas, and from there diffuses, specifically to lower population areas.},

Causal ML can be used in combination with both clinical trial data and real-world data, such as clinical registries and electronic health records, but caution is needed to avoid biased or incorrect predictions.

We propose an extension of the double/debiased machine learning framework to estimate the dynamic effects of treatments and apply it to a concrete linear Markovian high-dimensional state space model and to general structural nested mean models. Our method allows the use of arbitrary machine learning methods to control for the high dimensional state, subject to a mean square error guarantee, while still allowing parametric estimation and construction of confidence intervals for the dynamic treatment effect parameters of interest.  Our method is based on a sequential regression peeling process, which we show can be equivalently interpreted as a Neyman orthogonal moment estimator. This allows us to show root-n asymptotic normality of the estimated causal effects.},

	abstract = {This paper provides estimation and inference methods for conditional average treatment effects (CATE) characterized by a high-dimensional parameter in both homogeneous cross-sectional and unit-heterogeneous dynamic panel data settings. In our leading example, we model CATE by interacting the base treatment variable with explanatory variables. The first step of our procedure is orthogonalization, where we partial out the controls and unit effects from the outcome and the base treatment and take the cross-fitted residuals. This step uses a novel generic cross-fitting method that we design for weakly dependent time series and panel data. This method “leaves out the neighbors” when fitting nuisance components, and we theoretically power it by using Strassen's coupling. As a result, we can rely on any modern machine learning method in the first step, provided it learns the residuals well enough. Second, we construct an orthogonal (or residual) learner of CATE—the lasso CATE—that regresses the outcome residual on the vector of interactions of the residualized treatment with explanatory variables. If the complexity of CATE function is simpler than that of the first-stage regression, the orthogonal learner converges faster than the single-stage regression-based learner. Third, we perform simultaneous inference on parameters of the CATE function using debiasing. We also can use ordinary least squares in the last two steps when CATE is low-dimensional. In heterogeneous panel data settings, we model the unobserved unit heterogeneity as a weakly sparse deviation from Mundlak's (1978) model of correlated unit effects as a linear function of time-invariant covariates and make use of L1-penalization to estimate these models. We demonstrate our methods by estimating price elasticities of groceries based on scanner data. We note that our results are new even for the cross-sectional (i.i.d.) case.},

	abstract = {Governmental and nongovernmental organizations have increasingly relied on early-warning systems of conflict to support their decisionmaking. Predictions of war intensity as probability distributions prove closer to what policymakers need than point estimates, as they encompass useful representations of both the most likely outcome and the lower-probability risk that conflicts escalate catastrophically. Point-estimate predictions, by contrast, fail to represent the inherent uncertainty in the distribution of conflict fatalities. Yet, current early warning systems are preponderantly focused on providing point estimates, while efforts to forecast conflict fatalities as a probability distribution remain sparse. Building on the predecessor VIEWS competition, we organize a prediction challenge to encourage endeavours in this direction. We invite researchers across multiple disciplinary fields, from conflict studies to computer science, to forecast the number of fatalities in state-based armed conflicts, in the form of the UCDP ‘best’ estimates aggregated to two units of analysis (country-months and PRIO-GRID-months), with estimates of uncertainty. This article introduces the goal and motivation behind the prediction challenge, presents a set of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the forecasting models, describes the benchmark models which the contributions are evaluated against, and summarizes the salient features of the submitted contributions.},

We evaluate and quantify remote sensing data’s differentiated impact on forecasting accuracy across fine-grained spatial grid cells using the Syrian civil war as a use case.

	abstract = {Accurate and interpretable forecasting models predicting spatially and temporally fine-grained changes in the numbers of intrastate conflict casualties are of crucial importance for policymakers and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Using a count data approach, we propose a hierarchical hurdle regression model to address the corresponding prediction challenge at the monthly PRIO-grid level. More precisely, we model the intensity of local armed conflict at a specific point in time as a three-stage process. Stages one and two of our approach estimate whether we will observe any casualties at the country- and grid-cell-level, respectively, while stage three applies a regression model for truncated data to predict the number of such fatalities conditional upon the previous two stages. Within this modeling framework, we focus on the role of governmental arms imports as a processual factor allowing governments to intensify or deter from fighting. We further argue that a grid cell’s geographic remoteness is bound to moderate the effects of these military buildups. Out-of-sample predictions corroborate the effectiveness of our parsimonious and theory-driven model, which enables full transparency combined with accuracy in the forecasting process. Los modelos de previsión precisos e interpretables que predicen los cambios a nivel espacial y temporal en la cantidad de víctimas de los conflictos intraestatales son de vital importancia para los responsables políticos y las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG) internacionales. Utilizando un enfoque de datos de recuento, proponemos un modelo de regresión Hurdle jerárquico para abordar el correspondiente reto de predicción a nivel mensual de PRIO-GRID. Más concretamente, modelamos la intensidad del conflicto armado local en un momento determinado como un proceso de tres etapas. Las etapas uno y dos de nuestro enfoque estiman si observaremos alguna víctima a nivel de país y de celda de la red, respectivamente, mientras que la etapa tres aplica un modelo de regresión para datos truncados con el propósito de predecir la cantidad potencial de dichas víctimas mortales en función de las dos etapas anteriores. Dentro de este marco de modelización, nos centramos en el rol de las importaciones de armas por parte de los gobiernos como un factor de proceso que permite a los gobiernos intensificar o impedir los enfrentamientos. Además, sostenemos que la lejanía geográfica de una célula de la red está destinada a moderar los efectos de estas concentraciones militares. Las predicciones fuera de la muestra corroboran la eficacia de nuestro modelo parsimonioso y basado en la teoría, que permite una transparencia total combinada con precisión en el proceso de previsión. Les modèles de prévision précis et interprétables, qui permettent de prédire spatialement et temporellement les détails des changements dans les nombres de victimes de conflits intra-étatiques, sont d’une importance cruciale pour les décideurs politiques et les organizations non gouvernementales (ONG) internationales. Nous adoptons une approche par données de comptage et nous proposons un modèle de régression hiérarchique à obstacle (hurdle) pour relever le défi de la prédiction correspondante au niveau de la grille mensuelle du PRIO (Peace research institute Oslo, Institut de recherche sur la paix d’Oslo). Plus précisément, nous modélisons l’intensité des conflits armés locaux à un moment spécifique sous la forme d’un processus en trois étapes. Les étapes un et deux de notre approche consistent à estimer si nous observerons des pertes respectivement au niveau du pays et de la cellule de grille, tandis que l’étape trois consiste à appliquer un modèle de régression pour les données tronquées afin de prédire le nombre de ces pertes en fonction des deux étapes précédentes. Dans ce cadre de modélisation, nous nous concentrons sur le rôle des importations d’armes gouvernementales en tant que facteur processuel permettant aux gouvernements d’intensifier ou de dissuader les combats. Nous soutenons également que l’isolement géographique d’une cellule de la grille est susceptible de modérer les effets de ces renforcements militaires. Des prédictions hors échantillon corroborent l’efficacité de notre modèle parcimonieux fondé sur la théorie qui permet une totale transparence associée à une précision du processus de prévision.},

Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies, enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.},

It contains recent observations of candidate events, a majority of which are eventually included in the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Event Dataset as part of its annual update after a careful vetting process. We describe the definitions, sources and procedures employed to code the candidate events, and a set of issues that emerge when coding data on organized violence in near-real time. Together, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Candidate and Georeferenced Event Datasets minimize an inherent trade-off between update speed and quality control. Having monthly updated conflict data is advantageous for users needing near-real time monitoring of violent situations and aiming to anticipate future developments. To demonstrate this, we show that including them in a conflict forecasting system yields distinct improvements in terms of predictive performance: Average precision increases by 20–40\% relative to using the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Event Dataset only. We also show that to ensure quality and consistency, revisiting the initial coding making use of sources that become available later is absolutely necessary.},

These regimes are particularly effective for managing chronic disorders and is arguably one of the key aspects towards more personalized decision-making. In this paper, we investigate the online reinforcement learning (RL) problem for selecting optimal DTRs provided that observational data is available. We develop the first adaptive algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret in DTRs in online settings, without any access to historical data. We further derive informative bounds on the system dynamics of the underlying DTR from confounded, observational data. Finally, we combine these results and develop a novel RL algorithm that efficiently learns the optimal DTR while leveraging the abundant, yet imperfect confounded observations.},

While there is an extensive literature on tuning ML learners for prediction, there is only littleguidance available on tuning ML learners for causal machine learning. In this paper, we investigate the role of hyperparameter tuning and other practical decisions for causal estimation as based on the Double Machine Learning approach by Chernozhukov et al. (2018). Double Machine Learning relies on estimating so-called nuisance parameters by treating them as supervised learning problems and using them as plug-in estimates to solve for the (causal) parameter. We conduct an extensive simulation study using data from the 2019 Atlantic Causal Inference Conference Data Challenge. We provide empirical insights on the selection and calibration of the ML methods for the performance of causal estimation. First, we assess the importance of data splitting schemes for tuning ML learners within Double Machine Learning. Second, we investigate the choice of ML methods and hyperparameters, including recent AutoML frameworks, and consider the relationship between their predictive power and the estimation performance for a causal parameter of interest. Third, we investigate to what extent the choice of a particular causal model, as characterized by incorporated parametric assumptions, can be based on predictive performance metrics.},

In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

Its main task is to estimate treatment effects and make intervention policies. Traditionally, most of the previous works typically focus on the binary treatment setting that there is only one treatment for a unit to adopt or not. However, in practice, the treatment can be much more complex, encompassing multi-valued, continuous, or bundle options. In this paper, we refer to these as complex treatments and systematically and comprehensively review the causal inference methods for addressing them. First, we formally revisit the problem definition, the basic assumptions, and their possible variations under specific conditions. Second, we sequentially review the related methods for multi-valued, continuous, and bundled treatment settings. In each situation, we tentatively divide the methods into two categories: those conforming to the unconfoundedness assumption and those violating it. Subsequently, we discuss the available datasets and open-source codes. Finally, we provide a brief summary of these works and suggest potential directions for future research.},

These key features include best linear predictors of the effects using machine learning proxies, average effects sorted by impact groups, and average characteristics of most and least impacted units. The approach is valid in high-dimensional settings, where the effects are proxied (but not necessarily consistently estimated) by predictive and causal machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into estimates of the key features. Our approach is generic; it can be used in conjunction with penalized methods, neural networks, random forests, boosted trees, and ensemble methods, both predictive and causal. Estimation and inference are based on repeated data splitting to avoid overfitting and achieve validity. We use quantile aggregation of the results across many potential splits, in particular taking medians of p-values and medians and other quantiles of confidence intervals. We show that quantile aggregation lowers estimation risks over a single split procedure, and establish its principal inferential properties. Finally, our analysis reveals ways to build provably better machine learning proxies through causal learning: we can use the objective functions that we develop to construct the best linear predictors of the effects, to obtain better machine learning proxies in the initial step. We illustrate the use of both inferential tools and causal learners with a randomized field experiment that evaluates a combination of nudges to stimulate demand for immunization in India.},

Our causal estimands include the expected number of outcome events in a specified area under a particular stochastic treatment assignment strategy. Our methodology allows for arbitrary patterns of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. Using martingale theory, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as the number of time periods increases. We propose a sensitivity analysis for the possible existence of unmeasured confounders, and extend it to the Hájek estimator. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the estimators' finite sample performance. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods by estimating the effects of American airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq from February 2007 to July 2008. Our analysis suggests that increasing the average number of daily airstrikes for up to 1 month may result in more insurgent attacks. We also find some evidence that airstrikes can displace attacks from Baghdad to new locations up to 400 km away.},

We introduce a procedure for estimating causal effects and a nonparametric hypothesis test for these effects being zero. Our application is based on geospatial information on conflict events and remote-sensing-based data on forest loss between 2000 and 2018 in Colombia. Across the entire country, we estimate the effect to be slightly negative (conflict reduces forest loss) but insignificant (P = 0.578), while at the provincial level, we find both positive effects (e.g., La Guajira, P = 0.047) and negative effects (e.g., Magdalena, P = 0.004).

We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal variables. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.},

Accounting for spatial interference in spatiotemporal settings poses further challenges as interference violates the stable unit treatment value assumption, making it infeasible for standard causal inference methods to quantify the effects of time-varying treatment at spatially varying outcomes. In this paper, we first formalize the concept of spatial interference in the case of time-varying treatment assignments by extending the potential outcome framework under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. We then propose our deep learning based potential outcome model for spatiotemporal causal inference. We utilize latent factor modeling to reduce the bias due to time-varying confounding while leveraging the power of U-Net architecture to capture global and local spatial interference in data over time. Our causal estimators are an extension of average treatment effect (ATE) for estimating direct (DATE) and indirect effects (IATE) of spatial interference on treated and untreated data. Being the first of its kind deep learning based spatiotemporal causal inference technique, our approach shows advantages over several baseline methods based on the experiment results on two synthetic datasets, with and without spatial interference. Our results on real-world climate dataset also align with domain knowledge, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

The study found 46 relevant papers and emphasized the importance of considering unique predictors and conditioning factors for each conflict. It was found that the conflict susceptibility of a region is influenced principally by its socioeconomic conditions and its political/governance factors. We concluded that machine learning has the potential to be a valuable tool in conflict analysis and, therefore, it can be an asset in conflict mitigation and prevention, but the accuracy of the models depends on data quality and the careful selection of conditioning factors.

In this paper, we review one of the most prominent methods - "double/debiased machine learning" (DML) - and empirically evaluate it by comparing its performance on simulated data relative to more traditional statistical methods, before applying it to real-world data. Our findings indicate that the application of a suitably flexible machine learning algorithm within DML improves the adjustment for various nonlinear confounding relationships. This advantage enables a departure from traditional functional form assumptions typically necessary in causal effect estimation. However, we demonstrate that the method continues to critically depend on standard assumptions about causal structure and identification. When estimating the effects of air pollution on housing prices in our application, we find that DML estimates are consistently larger than estimates of less flexible methods. From our overall results, we provide actionable recommendations for specific choices researchers must make when applying DML in practice.},

The first half of this review examines recent advances in causal machine learning within a static framework, covering methods such as meta-learners, double machine learning, and causal forests, which improve conditional average treatment effect estimation and support personalized decision-making. The second half focuses on dynamic policy learning, which integrates dynamic treatment regimes and reinforcement learning techniques to address sequential decision problems. We discuss value-based, policy-based, and model-based approaches in both online and offline environments, and conclude with the challenges of offline settings, fundamentally a causal inference problem, together with strategies to address them.

	abstract = {Identifying causal effects from observational data is a pervasive challenge found throughout the empirical sciences. Very general methods have been developed to decide the identifiability of a causal quantity from a combination of observational data and causal knowledge about the underlying system. In practice, however, there are still challenges to estimating identifiable causal functionals from finite samples. Recently, a method known as double/debiased machine learning (DML) (Chernozhukov et al. 2018) has been proposed to learn parameters leveraging modern machine learning techniques, which is both robust to model misspecification and bias-reducing. Still, DML has only been used for causal estimation in settings when the back-door condition (also known as conditional ignorability) holds. In this paper, we develop a new, general class of estimators for any identifiable causal functionals that exhibit DML properties, which we name DML-ID. In particular, we introduce a complete identification algorithm that returns an influence function (IF) for any identifiable causal functional. We then construct the DML estimator based on the derived IF. We show that DML-ID estimators hold the key properties of debiasedness and doubly robustness. Simulation results corroborate with the theory.},

	abstract = {Traditional spatiotemporal data analysis often relies on predictive models that overlook causal relationships, making it difficult to identify true drivers and formulate effective interventions. To bridge this gap, we review causal machine learning (CML) techniques for spatiotemporal data, aiming to provide robust insights into their unique advantages. Our literature review reveals that fewer than 1\% of studies in major databases explicitly integrate CML with spatiotemporal analysis. After rigorous screening, we analyze 51 relevant papers, categorizing their contributions into four key areas (totaling 62 methodological approaches due to multi-category papers): 1) causal effect discovery and estimation (32 approaches), 2) prediction accuracy enhancement (19), 3) pattern recognition limitations (10), and 4) interpretability (1). This distribution highlights a critical research gap, particularly in interpretability and comprehensive frameworks. We further examine unique challenges in spatiotemporal data, such as spatial autocorrelation and temporal dependencies, that complicate causal inference but also present opportunities for innovation. Promising approaches include the synergy of spatiotemporal Granger causality and structural equation modeling with spatial lags, which capture complex interdependencies while preserving interpretability. Future directions include developing interpretable causal models, advancing real-time causal inference in dynamic environments, and addressing computational challenges (scalability, efficiency, and complexity-interpretability trade-offs). We also discuss ethical considerations, such as bias mitigation in causal discovery and societal implications of spatiotemporal causal inference. By synthesizing challenges and opportunities, this work advances the application of CML in spatiotemporal analysis, with implications for climate science, economics, epidemiology, and urban planning.},

We represent this structural function as a conditional expectation of an unbiased signal that depends on a nuisance parameter, which we estimate by modern machine learning techniques. We first adjust the signal to make it insensitive (Neyman-orthogonal) with respect to the first-stage regularisation bias. We then project the signal onto a set of basis functions, which grow with sample size, to get the best linear predictor of the structural function. We derive a complete set of results for estimation and simultaneous inference on all parameters of the best linear predictor, conducting inference by Gaussian bootstrap. When the structural function is smooth and the basis is sufficiently rich, our estimation and inference results automatically target this function. When basis functions are group indicators, the best linear predictor reduces to the group average treatment/structural effect, and our inference automatically targets these parameters. We demonstrate our method by estimating uniform confidence bands for the average price elasticity of gasoline demand conditional on income.},

First, data (over)aggregation obscures valuable spatial and temporal information, heightening the risk of mistaken inferences. Second, existing panel approaches either ignore spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects completely or impose overly restrictive assumptions. We introduce a general methodological framework and an accompanying open-source R package, geocausal, that enable spatiotemporal causal inference with arbitrary spillover and carryover effects. Using this framework, we demonstrate how to define and estimate causal quantities of interest, explore heterogeneous treatment effects, conduct causal mediation analysis, and perform data visualization.

Our results reveal that the risk of armed conflict is primarily influenced by stable background contexts with complex patterns, followed by climate deviations related covariates.

We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate.

I propose conditions for non-parametric identification that can remove both sources of bias and semi-parametrically estimate the spillover effects themselves including in settings with staggered treatment timing. To highlight the importance of spillover effects, I revisit analyses of three place-based interventions.},

However, this approach has not yet been widely applied to geographically referenced data, which present some unique issues: the random split of the test and training sets in the typical causal forest design fractures the spatial fabric of geographic data. To help solve this issue, we use a simulated dataset with known properties for average treatment effects and conditional average treatment effects to compare the performance of CF models across different definitions of the test/train split. We also develop a new “spatial” T-learner that can be implemented using predictive methods like random forest to provide estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects across all units. Our results show that all of the machine learning models outperform traditional ordinary least squares regression at identifying the true average treatment effect, but are not significantly different from one another. We then apply the preferred causal forest model in the context of analysing the treatment effect of the construction of the Valley Metro light rail (tram) system on on-road CO2 emissions per capita at the block group level in Maricopa County, Arizona, and find that the neighbourhoods most likely to benefit from treatment are those with higher pre-treatment proportions of transit and pedestrian commuting and lower proportions of auto commuting.},

	abstract = {Many social and environmental phenomena are associated with macroscopic changes in the built environment, captured by satellite imagery on a global scale and with daily temporal resolution. While widely used for prediction, these images and especially image sequences remain underutilized for causal inference, especially in the context of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where causal identification is established by design. In this paper, we develop and compare a set of general tools for analyzing Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) from temporal satellite data that can be applied to any RCT where geographical identifiers are available. Through a simulation study, we analyze different modeling strategies for estimating CATE in sequences of satellite images. We find that image sequence representation models with more parameters generally yield a greater ability to detect heterogeneity. To explore the role of model and data choice in practice, we apply the approaches to two influential RCTs -- Banerjee et al. (2015), a poverty study in Cusco, Peru, and Bolsen et al. (2014), a water conservation experiment in Georgia, USA. We benchmark our image sequence models against image-only, tabular-only, and combined image-tabular data sources, summarizing practical implications for investigators in a multivariate analysis. Land cover classifications over satellite images facilitate interpretation of what image features drive heterogeneity. We also show robustness to data and model choice of satellite-based generalization of the RCT results to larger geographical areas outside the original. Overall, this paper shows how satellite sequence data can be incorporated into the analysis of RCTs, and provides evidence about the implications of data, model, and evaluation metric choice for causal analysis.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can be leveraged across multiple causal trials while addressing chronic data scarcity in global development research. However, because standard training objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions often suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of causal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy evaluations. Existing debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), can handle this attenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the downstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in data-scarce environments. We introduce and evaluate two post-hoc correction methods -- Linear Calibration Correction (LCC) and a Tweedie's correction approach -- that substantially reduce shrinkage-induced prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled data. LCC applies a simple linear transformation estimated on a held-out calibration split; Tweedie's method locally de-shrink predictions using density score estimates and a noise scale learned upstream. We provide practical diagnostics for when a correction is warranted and discuss practical limitations. Across analytical results, simulations, and experiments with Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data, both approaches reduce attenuation; Tweedie's correction yields nearly unbiased treatment-effect estimates, enabling a "one map, many trials" paradigm. Although we demonstrate on EO-ML wealth mapping, the methods are not geospatial-specific: they apply to any setting where imputed outcomes are reused downstream (e.g., pollution indices, population density, or LLM-derived indicators).},

These measurements, sometimes called time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data, allow researchers to estimate a broad set of causal quantities, including contemporaneous effects and direct effects of lagged treatments. Unfortunately, popular methods for TSCS data can only produce valid inferences for lagged effects under some strong assumptions. In this paper, we use potential outcomes to define causal quantities of interest in these settings and clarify how standard models like the autoregressive distributed lag model can produce biased estimates of these quantities due to post-treatment conditioning. We then describe two estimation strategies that avoid these post-treatment biases—inverse probability weighting and structural nested mean models—and show via simulations that they can outperform standard approaches in small sample settings. We illustrate these methods in a study of how welfare spending affects terrorism.},

We propose a flexible, computationally efficient algorithm for growing generalized random forests, develop a large sample theory for our method showing that our estimates are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian and provide an estimator for their asymptotic variance that enables valid confidence intervals.

We first estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities in order to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. Our approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and easy to use: In both steps, we can use any loss-minimization method, e.g., penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property: Even if the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle who has a priori knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation setups, and find promising performance relative to existing baselines.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous effect estimation plays a crucial role in causal inference, with applications across medicine and social science. Many methods for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) have been proposed in recent years, but there are important theoretical gaps in understanding if and when such methods are optimal. This is especially true when the CATE has nontrivial structure (e.g., smoothness or sparsity). Our work contributes in several main ways. First, we study a two-stage doubly robust CATE estimator and give a generic model-free error bound, which, despite its generality, yields sharper results than those in the current literature. We apply the bound to derive error rates in nonparametric models with smoothness or sparsity, and give sufficient conditions for oracle efficiency. Underlying our error bound is a general oracle inequality for regression with estimated or imputed outcomes, which is of independent interest; this is the second main contribution. The third contribution is aimed at understanding the fundamental statistical limits of CATE estimation. To that end, we propose and study a local polynomial adaptation of double-residual regression. We show that this estimator can be oracle efficient under even weaker conditions, if used with a specialized form of sample splitting and careful choices of tuning parameters. These are the weakest conditions currently found in the literature, and we conjecture that they are minimal in a minimax sense. We go on to give error bounds in the non-trivial regime where oracle rates cannot be achieved. Some finite-sample properties are explored with simulations.},

However, conflict research- the empirical examination of political unrest, violence and civil war-has seen a growing emphasis on prediction and forecasting models. We describe automated machine learning (AutoML) to identify models, and human-guided machine learning (HGML), and show how these can incorporate domain knowledge and research requirements into model selection and assessment, and provide high quality machine learning pipelines to domain experts comparable to state-of-the-literature solutions. We examine three peer-reviewed papers with predictive models of conflict [3, 4, 5] and run their data through our HGML system using multiple AutoML engines and find this system produces slightly elevated performance on each paper's model, without any ML expertise required of the user. Our research has three takeaways for computational social science. First, predictive models of conflict would benefit from even minimal applications of AutoML; Secondly, human-guided machine learning offers the attractive option of constraining AutoML systems to address the kinds of questions conflict researchers assess with predictive models; Finally, current existing AutoML implementations produce divergent solutions and so can be productively harnessed in parallel.},

	abstract = {In 2022, the world experienced the deadliest year of armed conflict since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Much of the intensity and frequency of recent conflicts has drawn more attention to failures in forecasting—that is, a failure to anticipate conflicts. Such capabilities have the potential to greatly reduce the time, motivation, and opportunities peacemakers have to intervene through mediation or peacekeeping operations. In recent years, the growth in the volume of open-source data coupled with the wide-scale advancements in machine learning suggests that it may be possible for computational methods to help the international community forecast intrastate conflict more accurately, and in doing so reduce the rise of conflict. In this commentary, we argue for the promise of conflict forecasting under several technical and policy conditions. From a technical perspective, the success of this work depends on improvements in the quality of conflict-related data and an increased focus on model interpretability. In terms of policy implementation, we suggest that this technology should be used primarily to aid policy analysis heuristically and help identify unexpected conflicts.},

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations provide a blueprint of a better future by "leaving no one behind", and, to achieve the SDGs by 2030, poor countries require immense volumes of development aid. In this paper, we develop a causal machine learning framework for predicting heterogeneous treatment effects of aid disbursements to inform effective aid allocation. Specifically, our framework comprises three components: (i) a balancing autoencoder that uses representation learning to embed high-dimensional country characteristics while addressing treatment selection bias; (ii) a counterfactual generator to compute counterfactual outcomes for varying aid volumes to address small sample-size settings; and (iii) an inference model that is used to predict heterogeneous treatment-response curves. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using data with official development aid earmarked to end HIV/AIDS in 105 countries, amounting to more than USD 5.2 billion. For this, we first show that our framework successfully computes heterogeneous treatment-response curves using semi-synthetic data. Then, we demonstrate our framework using real-world HIV data. Our framework points to large opportunities for a more effective aid allocation, suggesting that the total number of new HIV infections could be reduced by up to 3.3\% ({\textasciitilde}50,000 cases) compared to the current allocation practice.},

	abstract = {Armed conflicts have detrimental impacts on the environment, including land systems. The prevailing understanding of the relation between Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and armed conflict fails to fully recognize the complexity of their dynamics – a shortcoming that could undermine food security and sustainable land/water resources management in conflict settings. The Syrian portion of the transboundary Orontes River Basin (ORB) has been a site of violent conflict since 2013. Correspondingly, the Lebanese and Turkish portions of the ORB have seen large influxes of refugees. A major challenge in any geoscientific investigation in this region, specifically the Syrian portion, is the unavailability of directly-measured “ground truth” data. To circumvent this problem, we develop a novel methodology that combines remote sensing products, machine learning techniques and quasi-experimental statistical analysis to better understand LULC changes in the ORB between 2004 and 2022. Through analysis of the resulting annual LULC maps, we can draw several quantitative conclusions. Cropland areas decreased by 21–24 \% in Syria's conflict hotspot zones after 2013, whereas a 3.4-fold increase was detected in Lebanon. The development of refugee settlements was also tracked in Lebanon and on the Syrian/Turkish borders, revealing different LULC patterns that depend on settlement dynamics. The results highlight the importance of understanding the heterogenous spatio-temporal LULC changes in conflict-affected and refugee-hosting countries. The developed methodology is a flexible, cloud-based approach that can be applied to wide variety of LULC investigations related to conflict, policy and climate.},

	abstract = {Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational (priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions to quantify forecast uncertainty. The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict. Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based peacebuilding initiatives.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2203.04511},
	abstract = {The causal mechanism between climate and political violence is fraught with complex mechanisms. Current quantitative causal models rely on one or more assumptions: (1) the climate drivers persistently generate conflict, (2) the causal mechanisms have a linear relationship with the conflict generation parameter, and/or (3) there is sufficient data to inform the prior distribution. Yet, we know conflict drivers often excite a social transformation process which leads to violence (e.g., drought forces agricultural producers to join urban militia), but further climate effects do not necessarily contribute to further violence. Therefore, not only is this bifurcation relationship highly non-linear, there is also often a lack of data to support prior assumptions for high resolution modeling. Here, we aim to overcome the aforementioned causal modeling challenges by proposing a neural forward-intensity Poisson process (NFIPP) model. The NFIPP is designed to capture the potential non-linear causal mechanism in climate induced political violence, whilst being robust to sparse and timing-uncertain data. Our results span 20 recent years and reveal an excitation-based causal link between extreme climate events and political violence across diverse countries. Our climate-induced conflict model results are cross-validated against qualitative climate vulnerability indices. Furthermore, we label historical events that either improve or reduce our predictability gain, demonstrating the importance of domain expertise in informing interpretation.},

We find that heterogeneity in incidence is explained by firm- and workforce-level variables. Firms with a large and heterogeneous workforce are most effective in passing on the incidence of the payroll tax to workers.},

We argue that aid shocks—severe decreases in aid revenues—inadvertently shift the domestic balance of power and potentially induce violence. During aid shocks, potential rebels gain bargaining strength vis-à-vis the government. To appease the rebels, the government must promise future resource transfers, but the government has no incentive to continue its promised transfers if the aid shock proves to be temporary. With the government unable to credibly commit to future resource transfers, violence breaks out. Using AidData's comprehensive dataset of bilateral and multilateral aid from 1981 to 2005, we evaluate the effects of foreign aid on violent armed conflict. In addition to rare-event logit analysis, we employ matching methods to account for the possibility that aid donors anticipate conflict.

	abstract = {In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.},

	abstract = {Citizen and community science datasets are typically collected using flexible protocols. These protocols enable large volumes of data to be collected globally every year; however, the consequence is that these protocols typically lack the structure necessary to maintain consistent sampling across years. This can result in complex and pronounced interannual changes in the observation process, which can complicate the estimation of population trends because population changes over time are confounded with changes in the observation process. Here we describe a novel modelling approach designed to estimate spatially explicit species population trends while controlling for the interannual confounding common in citizen science data. The approach is based on Double machine learning, a statistical framework that uses machine learning (ML) methods to estimate population change and the propensity scores used to adjust for confounding discovered in the data. ML makes it possible to use large sets of features to control for confounding and to model spatial heterogeneity in trends. Additionally, we present a simulation method to identify and adjust for residual confounding missed by the propensity scores. To illustrate the approach, we estimated species trends using data from the citizen science project eBird. We used a simulation study to assess the ability of the method to estimate spatially varying trends when faced with realistic confounding and temporal correlation. Results demonstrated the ability to distinguish between spatially constant and spatially varying trends. There were low error rates on the estimated direction of population change (increasing/decreasing) at each location and high correlations on the estimated magnitude of population change. The ability to estimate spatially explicit trends while accounting for confounding inherent in citizen science data has the potential to fill important information gaps, helping to estimate population trends for species and/or regions lacking rigorous monitoring data.},

We then show how reliable regression results can be obtained by adding a low dimensional spatial basis to the regression of interest, and applying a large cluster standard error correction. Examining 30 persistence studies in leading journals we find that few approach significance at conventional levels.

	abstract = {Data with a large number of variables relative to the sample size—"high-dimensional data"—are readily available and increasingly common in empirical economics. High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in "data mining" can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term "data mining" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for "true" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

In this paper, we consider how they can be identified in both structural and causal reduced-form models. First, discussing the various threats to identification in structural models, we point out that the typical estimation framework proposed in the applied spatial econometric literature boils down to considering spatial spillovers as a side-effect of a data-driven chosen specification. We also discuss the limits of blindly relying on interaction matrices purely based on geography to identify the source and content of spillovers. Then, we present reduced forms impact evaluation models for spatial data and show that the current spatial versions of usual impact evaluation models are not fully satisfactory when considering the identification issue. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations for applied articles aimed at identifying spatial spillovers.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal data, which captures how variables evolve across space and time, is ubiquitous in fields such as environmental science, epidemiology, and urban planning. However, identifying causal relationships in these datasets is challenging due to the presence of spatial dependencies, temporal autocorrelation, and confounding factors. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to spatiotemporal causal inference, offering both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for researchers and practitioners. We explore key concepts such as causal inference frameworks, the impact of confounding in spatiotemporal settings, and the challenges posed by spatial and temporal dependencies. The paper covers synthetic spatiotemporal benchmark data generation, widely used spatiotemporal causal inference techniques, including regression-based, propensity score-based, and deep learning-based methods, and demonstrates their application using synthetic datasets. Through step-by-step examples, readers will gain a clear understanding of how to address common challenges and apply causal inference techniques to spatiotemporal data. This tutorial serves as a valuable resource for those looking to improve the rigor and reliability of their causal analyses in spatiotemporal contexts.},

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.},

We then argue that recent advances in DiD methods can be broadly classified as relaxing some components of the canonical DiD setup, with a focus on (i) multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, (ii) potential violations of parallel trends, or (iii) alternative frameworks for inference. Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work. We conclude by discussing some promising areas for future research.},

We argue that progress has been hampered by insufficient attention paid to the context in which droughts and other climatic extremes may increase the risk of violent mobilization. Addressing this shortcoming, this study presents an actor-oriented analysis of the drought-conflict relationship, focusing specifically on politically relevant ethnic groups and their sensitivity to growing-season drought under various political and socioeconomic contexts. To this end, we draw on new conflict event data that cover Asia and Africa, 1989-2014, updated spatial ethnic settlement data, and remote sensing data on agricultural land use. Our procedure allows quantifying, for each ethnic group, drought conditions during the growing season of the locally dominant crop. A comprehensive set of multilevel mixed effects models that account for the groups' livelihood, economic, and political vulnerabilities reveals that a drought under most conditions has little effect on the short-term risk that a group challenges the state by military means. However, for agriculturally dependent groups as well as politically excluded groups in very poor countries, a local drought is found to increase the likelihood of sustained violence. We interpret this as evidence of the reciprocal relationship between drought and conflict, whereby each phenomenon makes a group more vulnerable to the other.},

Yet, we know little about the limits of these approaches, even though information about these limits has critical implications for both future research and policy-making. In particular, are our predictive inaccuracies due to limitations of our models, data, or assumptions, in which case improvements should occur incrementally.

Estimators of β based on incorrect parameterization of θ are generally inconsistent, whereas consistent nonparametric estimators deviate from β by a larger probability order than N$^{\textrm{-1/2}}$, where N is sample size. An estimator generalizing the ordinary least squares estimator of β is constructed by inserting nonparametric regression estimators in the nonlinear orthogonal projection on Z.

ViEWS produces monthly forecasts at the country and subnational level for 36 months into the future and all three UCDP types of organized violence: state-based conflict, non-state conflict, and one-sided violence in Africa. The article presents the methodology and data behind these forecasts, evaluates their predictive performance, provides selected forecasts for October 2018 through October 2021, and indicates future extensions. ViEWS is built as an ensemble of constituent models designed to optimize its predictions. Each of these represents a theme that the conflict research literature suggests is relevant, or implements a specific statistical/machine-learning approach. Current forecasts indicate a persistence of conflict in regions in Africa with a recent history of political violence but also alert to new conflicts such as in Southern Cameroon and Northern Mozambique. The subsequent evaluation additionally shows that ViEWS is able to accurately capture the long-term behavior of established political violence, as well as diffusion processes such as the spread of violence in Cameroon. The performance demonstrated here indicates that ViEWS can be a useful complement to non-public conflict-warning systems, and also serves as a reference against which future improvements can be evaluated.},

In the current version, the dataset covers 50 unstable countries from 1997 through 2010. ACLED's disaggregation of civil war and transnational violent events allow for research on local level factors and the dynamics of civil and communal conflict. Findings from subnational conflict research challenges conclusions from larger national-level studies. In a brief descriptive analysis, the authors find that, on average, conflict covers 15\% of a state's territory, but almost half of a state can be directly affected by internal wars.},

The UCDP GED is an event dataset that disaggregates three types of organized violence (state-based conflict, non-state conflict, and one-sided violence) both spatially and temporally. Each event – defined as an instance of organized violence with at least one fatality – comes with date, geographical location, and identifiers that allow the dataset to be linked to and merged with other UCDP datasets. The first version of the dataset covers events of fatal violence on the African continent between 1989 and 2010. This article, firstly, introduces the rationale for the new dataset, and explains the basic coding procedures as well as the quality controls. Secondly, we discuss some of the data’s potential weaknesses in representing the universe of organized violence, as well as some potential biases induced by the operationalizations. Thirdly, we provide an example of how the data can be used, by illustrating the association between cities and organized violence, taking population density into account. The UCDP GED is a useful resource for conflict analyses below the state and country-year levels, and can provide us with new insights into the geographical determinants and temporal sequencing of warfare and violence.},

A key challenge of conflict forecasting for prevention is that outbreaks of conflict in previously peaceful countries are rare events and therefore hard to predict. To make progress in this hard problem, this project summarizes more than four million newspaper articles using a topic model. The topics are then fed into a random forest to predict conflict risk, which is then integrated into a simple static framework in which a decision maker decides on the optimal number of interventions to minimize the total cost of conflict and intervention. According to the stylized model, cost savings compared to not intervening pre-conflict are over US\$1 trillion even with relatively ineffective interventions and US\$13 trillion with effective interventions.},

The text features are generated from over 3.5 million newspaper articles using a so-called topic-model. We show that the combined model relies to a large extent on conflict dynamics, but that text is able to contribute meaningfully to the prediction of rare outbreaks of violence in previously peaceful countries. Given the very powerful dynamics of the conflict trap these cases are particularly important for prevention efforts. Este artículo propone un nuevo método para la predicción de escaladas y desescaladas de violencia a través de la aplicación de un modelo basado en los antecedentes del conflicto y las características propias del texto. Las características del texto se generan a partir de más de 3,5 millones de artículos de periódicos mediante el uso de lo que se denomina “modelo de tópicos”. Demostramos que, si bien este modelo combinado hace referencia a una extensa dinámica del conflicto, el texto es una contribución relevante que permite predecir los estallidos de violencia inesperados en países que antes eran pacíficos. Dada la dinámica de gran intensidad característica de la trampa del conflicto, estos casos son de especial importancia en lo que se refiere a las iniciativas de prevención. Dans cet article, nous proposons une nouvelle méthode destinée à anticiper les escalades et désescalades de violence grâce à un modèle reposant sur les antécédents conflictuels et sur des caractéristiques textuelles. Ces caractéristiques sont extraites à partir de plus de 3,5 millions d’articles de presse à l’aide d’un modèle thématique (topic model). Nous montrons que si ce modèle mixte s’appuie largement sur les dynamiques conflictuelles, les données textuelles peuvent être très utiles en vue d’anticiper les rares explosions de violence dans les pays habituellement pacifiques. Étant donné la puissante dynamique qui sous-tend les conflits récurrents, les exemples exposés revêtent une importance particulière dans une optique de prévention.},

	abstract = {This article presents results and lessons learned from a prediction competition organized by ViEWS to improve collective scientific knowledge on forecasting (de-)escalation in Africa. The competition call asked participants to forecast changes in state-based violence for the true future (October 2020–March 2021) as well as for a held-out test partition. An external scoring committee, independent from both the organizers and participants, was formed to evaluate the models based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria, including performance, novelty, uniqueness, and replicability. All models contributed to advance the research frontier by providing novel methodological or theoretical insight, including new data, or adopting innovative model specifications. While we discuss several facets of the competition that could be improved moving forward, the collection passes an important test. When we build a simple ensemble prediction model—which draws on the unique insights of each contribution to differing degrees—we can measure an improvement in the prediction from the group, over and above what the average individual model can achieve. This wisdom of the crowd effect suggests that future competitions that build on both the successes and failures of ours, can contribute to scientific knowledge by incentivizing diverse contributions as well as focusing a group’s attention on a common problem. Este artículo presenta los resultados y las enseñanzas extraídas en el marco de un certamen de predicción organizado por los responsables del proyecto Sistema de Alerta Temprana de Violencia (Violence Early-Warning System, ViEWS) con el propósito de mejorar los conocimientos científicos colectivos sobre la previsión de la (des)escalada en el continente africano. En el certamen se pidió a los participantes que desarrollaran una previsión con respecto a los cambios en la violencia estatal para el futuro real (de octubre de 2020 a marzo de 2021), así como para una muestra de prueba que se mantendría. Se formó un comité de calificación externo, independiente tanto de los organizadores como de los participantes, para evaluar los modelos en función de criterios cualitativos y cuantitativos, como el rendimiento, la novedad, la singularidad y la replicabilidad. Todos los modelos contribuyeron a avanzar en la frontera de la investigación mediante el aporte de nuevos conocimientos metodológicos o teóricos, la inclusión de nuevos datos o la adopción de especificaciones innovadoras del modelo. Aunque se debarió sobre varios aspectos del certamen que podrían mejorarse de cara al futuro, lo que se recopiló pasó una prueba importante. Cuando se construye un simple modelo de predicción de conjunto, que se basa en los conocimientos únicos de cada contribución en diferentes grados, se puede medir una mejora en la predicción del grupo, por encima de lo que el modelo individual promedio puede lograr. Este efecto de la sabiduría de la multitud sugiere que los futuros certámenes que se basen tanto en los éxitos como en los fracasos propios, pueden contribuir al conocimiento científico incentivando diversas contribuciones, así como centrando la atención de un grupo en un problema común. Cet article présente les résultats et les enseignements tirés d’un concours de prédiction organisé par ViEWS (Violence early-warning system, système d’alerte précoce sur la violence) pour améliorer nos connaissances scientifiques collectives en prévision de la (dés)escalade de la violence sur le continent africain. L’appel à concours demandait aux participants de prévoir les évolutions de la violence étatique pour le futur réel (octobre 2020-mars 2021) ainsi que pour une partition test retenue. Un comité de notation externe, indépendant à la fois des organisateurs et des participants, a été constitué pour évaluer les modèles à la fois sur des critères qualitatifs et quantitatifs, notamment sur leurs performances, leur nouveauté, leur unicité et leur reproductibilité. Tous les modèles ont contribué à faire avancer la frontière des recherches en apportant un éclairage méthodologique ou théorique inédit, en incluant de nouvelles données ou en adoptant des caractéristiques de modèle innovantes. Bien que nous abordions plusieurs facettes du concours qui pourraient être améliorées en allant de l’avant, l’ensemble de modèles a réussi un test important. Lorsque nous concevons un modèle de prédiction par ensemble simple - qui s’appuie sur les renseignements uniques de chaque contribution aux différents degrés -, nous pouvons mesurer une amélioration de la prédiction du groupe par rapport à ce que le modèle individuel moyen permet d’obtenir. Cet effet de sagesse de la foule suggère que les futurs concours, qui s’appuieront à la fois sur les réussites et les échecs du nôtre, pourront contribuer aux connaissances scientifiques en encourageant des contributions diverses et en concentrant l’attention d’un groupe sur un problème commun.},

While this is a welcome trend, it necessitates geographic information systems (GIS) skills and imposes new challenges for data collection and analysis. So far, solutions to these challenges differ between studies, obstructing direct comparison of findings and hampering replication and extension of earlier work. This article presents a standardized structure for storing, manipulating, and analyzing high-resolution spatial data. PRIO-GRID is a vector grid network with a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees, covering all terrestrial areas of the world. Gridded data comprise inherently apolitical entities; the grid cells are fixed in time and space, they are insensitive to political boundaries and developments, and they are completely exogenous to likely features of interest, such as civil war outbreak, ethnic settlement patterns, extreme weather events, or the spatial distribution of wealth. Moreover, unlike other disaggregated approaches, gridded data may be scaled up or down in a consistent manner by varying the resolution of the grid. The released dataset comes with cell-specific information on a large selection of political, economic, demographic, environmental, and conflict variables for all years, 1946–2008. A simple descriptive data assessment of population density and economic activity is offered to demonstrate how PRIO-GRID may be applied in quantitative social science research.},

We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting, models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g., Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured external knowledge.},

	abstract = {This study advances the field of conflict forecasting by using text-based actor embeddings with transformer models to predict dynamic changes in violent conflict patterns at the actor level. More specifically, we combine newswire texts with structured conflict event data and leverage recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast escalations and de-escalations among conflicting actors, such as governments, militias, separatist movements, and terrorists. This new approach accurately and promptly captures the inherently volatile patterns of violent conflicts, which existing methods have not been able to achieve. To create this framework, we began by curating and annotating a vast international newswire corpus, leveraging hand-labeled event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. By using this hybrid dataset, our models can incorporate the textual context of news sources along with the precision and detail of structured event data. This combination enables us to make both dynamic and granular predictions about conflict developments. We validate our approach through rigorous back-testing against historical events, demonstrating superior out-of-sample predictive power. We find that our approach is quite effective in identifying and predicting phases of conflict escalation and de-escalation, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models. By focusing on actor interactions, our explicit goal is to provide actionable insights to policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and peacekeeping operations in order to enable targeted and effective intervention strategies.},
