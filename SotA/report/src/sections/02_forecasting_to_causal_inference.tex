\subsection{The State of the Art in Conflict Forecasting}
Contemporary conflict forecasting has moved beyond small-scale country-specific desings used in earlier research \cite{cederman_predicting_2017, hegre_introduction_2017}.
Trough efforts, such as the Violence and Impacts Early-Warning System (VIEWS) \cite{hegre_views_2019} or ACLED Volatility Risk Index/CAST \cite{rod_review_2024} and a "revolution" in data as well as methodology, the scope and predictive performance of forecasting in conflict research increased substantially \cite{croicu_forecasting_2025}.
Current data---led by datasets such as the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED) \cite{sundberg_introducing_2013} or the Armed Conflict Event and Location Dataset (ACLED) \cite{raleigh_introducing_2010}---caputers local dynamics troguh global collections of individual armed conflict events on a daily basis over a long time-series.
This highpy disaggregated microdata with millions of data-points is then often leveraged to perform a spatio-temporal aggregation; typically a PRIO-GRID lattice \cite{tollefsen_prio-grid_2012} with $0.5^\circ \times 0.5^\circ$ spatil grid cells ($55 \times 55$ km$^2$ at the equator) and a temporal resolution of a month is used \cite{hegre_202324_2025, hegre_views_2019}.
These event-based frameworks are usually complemented with structural covarites---static, long-term data like economic and social indicators---to combine conflict dynamics with underlying socio-economic conditions \cite{tollefsen_prio-grid_2012, hegre_views_2019, rod_review_2024}.
Furthemore, integration of remote sensing data variables (e.g., vegetation indices, satillite imagery) have further enhanced this spatial granularity \cite{mueller_monitoring_2021, mhanna_using_2023, racek_conflict_2024}.

Recent models perform well at static risk assessment but have limited capabilities at predicting conflict dynamics (e.g., onsets, escalations, and terminations) \cite{mueller_monitoring_2021, vesco_united_2022}.
Methodologically, most of today's approaches are using non-parametric ensembles(e.g., XGBoost or Random Forests) that excel at capturing non-linear interactions and minimizing predictive error (e.g., Brier scores) \cite{hegre_views_2019, hegre_views2020_2021}.
A current evolution in the field is moving from manual feature engineering to deep learning, with some frontier models adopting architectures that autonomously learn representations and capture intricate long-term temporal dependencies \cite{croicu_forecasting_2025}.
Examples include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers, such as Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) \cite{hegre_202324_2025, vesco_united_2022}.
Another emerging approach is direct forecasting from news corpora by using Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) \cite{croicu_newswire_2025, nemkova_large_2025}.
While such "black box" ML models maximize metrics like AUROC, they lack interpretability and obscure structural mechanisms \cite{murphy_promise_2024, cederman_predicting_2017}.
Most empirical studies also treat conflict diffusion simply as a nuisance, controlling for it by including simple spatial and temporal lags; this leads to very limited insights on the diffusion of armed conflict \cite{racek_capturing_2025}.
Research by \textcite{racek_capturing_2025} addresses these gaps by utilizing a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with non-parametric smoothing.
Therefore, the model can capture the spatio-temporal diffusion of conflict over large distances and temporal lags of up to 24 months while remaining fully interpretable.

\subsection{The Missing Causal Uderestanding}

% The VIEWS (Violence \& Impacts Early-Warning System) prediction challenge has emerged as the gold standard for benchmarking forecasting models in this domain \citep{hegre2025views}. This collaborative effort has spurred methodological innovation across diverse algorithmic approaches, from gradient-boosted trees and complex ensembles to neural networks. Notably, \citet{racek2025capturing} develop a generalized additive model (GAM) with nonparametric smoothing that captures spatio-temporal diffusion effects across distances up to 550 km and time lags of 24 months. Their model, fit to 10,640 grid cells across Africa over 252 monthly observations (2000--2020), achieves 33.5\% out-of-sample explained deviance while maintaining full interpretability of all parameters---a deliberate departure from black-box machine learning approaches. This dataset and modeling framework provides the foundation for the present project.

% Despite these advances, the VIEWS competition revealed a sobering insight: even sophisticated models are frequently outperformed by a simple ``no-change'' baseline that predicts null change in fatalities, particularly for conflict onset in previously peaceful locations \citep{hegre2025views}. This observation underscores that predictive accuracy alone, however impressive, cannot answer the questions most relevant to policy intervention.
