Extends causal forests to panel data under parallel trends assumption (DiDCF method). Enables data-driven heterogeneous treatment effect discovery in staggered treatment designs without requiring random assignment. Builds on Athey \& Imbens (2022) changes-in-changes framework. Particularly useful when treatment timing varies across units.
